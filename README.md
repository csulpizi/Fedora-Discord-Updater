**fedora_discord_install**

Helper script for installing / updating discord on fedora

**Rationale**

Updating Discord on Fedora is not super convenient: running an outdated version of Discord will force you to download a .deb file, which is not natively supported by Fedora. (Frustrating)

**Usage**

`sudo sh update_discord.sh`

Will download and unpack the newest version of discord.
