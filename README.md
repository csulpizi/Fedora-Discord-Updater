# fedora_discord_install
Helper script for installing / updating discord on fedora

# Rationale
Updating Discord on Fedora is not super convenient: running an outdated version of Discord will force you to download a .deb file, which is not natively supported by Fedora. (Frustrating)

# Usage
`.sh update_discord.sh`

Will download, unpack, and run the newest version of discord. Discord will now be up to date.
